# python-api-challenge
This challenge involves using Python and APIs to analyze weather patterns and their relationship to latitude. The first part, WeatherPy, requires retrieving weather data from over 500 cities using OpenWeatherMap and visualizing key relationships—such as temperature, humidity, and cloudiness—with latitude using scatter plots and regression analysis. The second part, VacationPy, applies this weather data to identify ideal vacation destinations based on preferred climate conditions and map hotels in those areas using Geoapify. Through data manipulation, visualization, and geographic analysis, this assignment demonstrates the power of data-driven decision-making.
